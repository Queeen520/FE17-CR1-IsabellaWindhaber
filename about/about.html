      <h2>What's the secret behinde Food Blog ?</h2>
      <br>
      <p>We startet some years ago with this Blog just to have a place
        where we can store 
        <br>our most loved recipes and also share it with our Friends
        and Family. 
        <br>Than we added our most favorite restaurants in the city and stuff
        like that. 
        <br>It didn't took a long time since people startet to ask about the places
        and recipes and also wantet to share their content.
      </p><br>
      <P>And so we startet to Co-Work with Food Blogger or just Food Lover from all
        around the world! 
        <br>We don't do it for money and we also don't pay our Bloggers. 
        <br>Everyone can write us and share content if it fits to our website!
      </P>

        <h3>We proudly can say that we don't earn money that we keep!</h3>
        <p>We never wantet to earn money with this blog, so it's importat to us 
           <br> that you know, everything we earn goes to the <b>Feed The World Foundation</b>!
        </p>
        <p>But we think that we all could do more to stop hunger around the world!
           <br> So we decided to something new this year. We will do a FoundRaising next Month!
           <br> (More Informations will follow soon)
           <br> We just ask everyone to give as much as is possible for you in your situation!
           <br> Every donation counts!
